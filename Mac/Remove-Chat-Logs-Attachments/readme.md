This script is stupid simple.. But makes it easy to delete chat logs on your (or your employers) apple computer. I found this task tedious and repetitive and not as easy as it should be.

Save the file to your hard drive as simply "remove_chat_logs" (no extension). It is already an executable file, so just double click it and follow the instructions.



> Note- no files will ever be deleted without you first giving the OK. 

> Keep the file on the desktop (or wherever you want to put it) and run it as often as you want.

> Thanks and thanks.
