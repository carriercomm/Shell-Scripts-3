Command line & Shell Scripts I use often

These are command line (shell) script files that automate common tasks on my apple computer..

I keep these in a folder in my dock and use them often.. Especially the CloneRepo, EditPath, and EditHosts command files.. And just because it is often necessary after editing $PATH, etc, I also have a KillFinder command..

_My most used command file is most definitely CloneRepo.command_

 *NOTE* - The best use of this command file is to place it in the root folder where all of your 
	   git repos are cloned to. That way, you never have to manually clone a repo again. 
	   Just run this file, enter the GitHub username and repo name, and a folder will be generated
	   in the directory and populated with the cloned repo files. Tada!
