Command line & Shell Scripts I use often

These are command line (shell) script files that automate common tasks on my apple computer..

I keep these in a folder in my dock and use them often.. Especially the CloneRepo, EditPath, and EditHosts command files.. And just because it is often necessary after editing $PATH, etc, I also have a KillFinder command..
